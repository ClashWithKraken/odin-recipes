<h3>Pork chops are a quick, healthy and simple dinner. Our method ensures juicy, tender, and flavorful pork chops with little fuss.</h3>
<p>
<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 pork chops, about 1-inch thick and 6 to 7 ounces each,</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chili powder, see our homemade chili powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil like avocado oil or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken stock, see our homemade chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons honey or brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, optional</li>
</ul>
<h2> Steps </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Take the pork chops out of the refrigerator and season on both sides with salt — we use just less than 1/4 teaspoon of salt per pork chop. Set the chops aside to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make the spice rub. Mix the flour, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>After 30 minutes, use a paper towel to dry the pork chops, then rub both sides of the chops with the spice rub.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a skillet (with a lid) over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and looks shimmery, add the pork. Cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Flip the pork so that the seared side is facing up. If there is a fattier side of the pork, use kitchen tongs to hold the chops fat-side-down until it sizzles and browns slightly, <br>
        about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to low, then cover the skillet with a lid. Cook for 6 to 12 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reads 145° F when inserted into the thickest part of the <br>
        chop. Cook time depends on the thickness of the chops, so check for doneness at 5 minutes, then go from there, checking every 2 minutes after that. If you do not have a thermometer,<br>
         you will know they are done, if, when cutting into the chops, the juices run clear.</li>
    <li>Transfer pork chops to a plate, then cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let the pork rest for 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<h3> Pan Sauce </h3>
<ol>
    <li>While the pork rests, make the pan sauce. Increase the heat to medium-high, then add the chicken stock, vinegar, and honey. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of <br>
        the pan so that any stuck bits of pork come up.</li>
    <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Taste, then adjust with additional salt, vinegar, or honey.</li>
    <li>Slide the skillet off the heat, wait until the sauce stops simmering, then swirl in the butter.</li>
    <li>Slide the pork chops back into the pan and spoon some of the sauce over them. Alternatively, slice the chops, then place them back into the pan. Scatter fresh parsley <br>
        over the pork, and then serve.</li>
